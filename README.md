# Cookbook

This is a Flutter project for a demo app named Cookbook.

## What is it for?

This project was written for the purpose of an analysis concerning a master's thesis.
It is a simple recipe sharing app that offers basic functionality such as:
  - Creating recipes and storing them on a server
  - Editing your existing recipes
  - Searching for recipes by categories
  - Deleting recipes
  - Adding recipes to favorites independently for each user

The project was a learning one, so while I tried to apply best practices, there may be some potential improvements that could be implemented.
The focus of the project was to learn widget customization, state management with Provider, async code including http requests, and using a simple local storage solution with SharedPreferences.
